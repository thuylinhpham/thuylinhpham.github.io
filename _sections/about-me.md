Hmm, what should I write about myself? I guess the whole point is to be honest then okay. I was born on 19th August 1992 so basically I am 28 years old. 28, it means that I am not a teenager anymore nor an adult. While my friends are all having their own families with their cute children, I am still trying to figure out what should I do in my life, something like what I'll eat for dinner, is my work in the lab good enough, etc? Well, I haven't mentioned that I am doing a Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering in South Korea, and next year I'll graduate. What'll happen after that I am quite not sure. I am excited about this day but also afraid of it. The day I graduate is the day I am no longer a student, I become something else. I'll have to find a job to take care of not only myself but also my parents. They are getting old and it's time for me to give them back all the incredible things that they sacrificed for me. I know I am a good, hard-working student and I am smart so things 'll be fine. However, we cannot say anything about the future, right? All of the randomness and responsibilities are waiting for me ahead, wish I could have "magic beans" like Rachael in "Friends" sitcom when she was just a waitress and had no idea about her life. 

Everything I wrote so far sounds unpleasant. Maybe I should write something more fun, like my hobbies. I love anime. I watched a lot of anime since I was a little girl. Ghibli is my favorite anime studio of all time. Have you ever watched "Grave of the Fireflies"? I cried every time I watched it because the story was so real and touching. But it doesn't mean that I don't like the other animation film. I myself is a loyal fan of "One piece". I hope you at least once in your life heard about it. The boy Luffy and his crew on their journey to become private king and their amazing friendship are the spirits that I want to achieve in my life. Freedom and have the people you love that love you back. I follow this anime almost 10 years now and I will till the final episode ^^. I love music too. I guess everyone loves it. Normally, when I listen to a song, I really can feel the emotion that the artist wants to express. My friends think I am too sensitive and it's not good for this reality. I know they're right but I don't wanna change that, it's who I am. Like I can talk about a good movie for hours or discuss my favorite songs nonstop. You see, not mature enough for a 28 years old. I should focus on serious stuff like job, salary, marriage instead of enjoying a cup of coffee alone on a rainy day or crying over a melodramatic scene.
