My name is Thuy Linh Pham and I am a Vietnamese student, who is currently studying Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering at Chonnam National University, South Korea. Every day I spend most of my time in the lab working on experiments and data analysis. I focus on the conductivity measurement of ceramic samples, application of impedance spectroscopy to electrochemical systems, and recently learn how to apply Python to materials science. In my spare time, I love to listen to music through my headphones while walking around my university. Lately, I am into Harry Style and James Arthur's songs a lot. I love anime too, and "One piece" is my favorite ^^. My zodiac is Leo which means I am creative, passionate, warm-hearted, and have strong leadership skills. However, I can be arrogant and a bit stubborn as well.
