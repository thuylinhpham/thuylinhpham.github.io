My name is Thuy Linh Pham and I am a Vietnamese student, who is currently studying Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering at Chonnam National University, South Korea. Every day I spend most of my time in the lab working on experiments and data analysis. I focus on the conductivity measurement of ceramic samples, application of impedance spectroscopy to electrochemical systems, and recently learn how to apply Python to materials science.
