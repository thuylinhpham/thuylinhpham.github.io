My name is Thuy Linh Pham and I am a Vietnamese. I am studying Ph.D in Materials Science and Engineering at Chonnam National University, South Korea. Everyday I spend most of my time in the lab working on experiments and data analysis. I focus on conductivity measurement of ceramics sample, application of impedance spectroscopy to electrochemical system, and recently learn how to apply Python to materials science. In my spare time, I love to walk around my university while listening to songs through my headphone. Lately I am into Harry Style and James Arthur's songs a lot. I love anime too, and "One piece" is my favorite ^^.
